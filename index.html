    <h2>PROFILE</h2>
    <hr>
    <P>Resourceful, reliable, and self-driven 
        individual with an eagerness to learn. I am 
        a well-rounded professional team player 
        dedicated to continuing my academic 
        pursuits. I am adaptable to all challenging 
        situations being able to work well in a team 
        environment as well as using my own
        initiative.
    </P>
    <P>My passion for Software and cyber was 
        found as l took up Computer Science as a 
        subject. Now l continue to learn more 
        about this field through any means possible 
        and some of the means are through
        reading different related blogs, namely the 
        Pinterest Engineering blog, and spending 
        time on different websites such as
        dash.generalassemb.ly, Solo Learn, and 
        the Odin project. This helps me to stay up 
        to date with new technology and to further 
        my knowledge and enrich myself in 
        different aspects in relation to Software 
        and cyber. I am looking for an environment 
        where l can learn, grow and eventually go 
        on to take responsibility for larger projects.
    </P>

    <h3>WORK EXPIRIENCE</h3>
    <hr>
    <ul>
        <li>*[Dates January 2022 – December 2022]</li>
        <li>*[Location- Pietermaritzburg, South Africa]</li>
        <li>*[Name Of Current Program Enrolled In- Destiney Leadership Academy]</li>
    </ul>
    <p>My name is Masimba Knowledge Kwari and l am aged 19 years old. I finished high school last year in 2021. Upon my 
        completion of studies, l decided to dedicate my whole year of 2022 towards a program known as Destiney Leadership 
        Academy. This program attracts a vast variety of students, coming from across South Africa as well as from Europe, 
        Canada, and North America. This Academy is designed as an intensive, one-year program that will challenge the students 
        emotionally, intellectually, spiritually, and physically.</p>
    <p>In this program as students, we are required to help the needy, go on mission trips, attend courses and lectures and 
        develop our skill set. Through undertaking this program this year l have had the wonderful opportunity of traveling to 
        several places impacting various communities in and out of South Africa. Through this program, l have had the 
        wonderful opportunity of visiting countries such as Germany, the island of Malta, Lesotho, and a few more. Through 
        traveling in this way l have had the wonderful opportunity of ministering to different nations to people of different 
        cultural backgrounds and languages. I along with other fellow students have served many diverse communities with 
        different needs on a voluntary basis and it has been an amazing experience of growth within oneself. Through being 
        immersed in this environment l have learned that everyone has leadership potential. We are all required to lead 
        ourselves, our families, and other people. Destiny Leadership Academy nurtures and grows this potential in its students 
        and aims to raise competent and passionate leaders.</p>
    <p>This is a challenging, focused, and adventurous experience in a Christian-centered environment. Our daily life is 
        structured, and we pursue the theory and practical components of a tailor-made curriculum. In undertaking this 
        program throughout the year 2022, it has given me more time to think intensely about my future and what l would like 
        to become. I have also had the wonderful opportunity of interacting with people involved in different spheres of 
        industry who have given me valuable career guidance. Through the research l have done both online and through 
        interacting with people, l have felt drawn towards the area of either software engineering or cyber security. This is 
        where my passion resides and my hope is to begin my studies in the year 2023 in either studying a bachelor in software 
        engineering or a bachelor in cyber security. I have had much time to think about this and l am fully determined to pursue 
        my studies and achieve my goals.</p>
